Worked some with Megan Reddy on this lab.




Let's practice working with cellular operations.

## 1. Code-In-The-Blanks
Imagine a terrain height field, where white is the highest height and black is the lowest height. We'll stick to 2d for ease of visualization. We can generate an interesting organic-looking height field like this with noise:

Not bad, but not good either. We can make it look MORE like terrain by mimicking the effects of erosion. If you imagine material sliding down steep slopes to re-distribute some of the height, it might look more like this:

Fork [this base code](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cdl3W4) and replicate (to the best of your ability) this erosion effect. More detailed instructions inside! 

## 2. Beautiful colors
Add some coloring to give the terrain some personality.

## 3. Extra Credit
Too easy? Copy pasta some ray marching code in so we can see your terrain erosion work in 3D!

## Submission
- Create a pull request to this repository
- In the README, include the names of both your team members
